   Hello,

   The raw data for EASI_62 is available on the CNAG's ftp server, and can
   be downloaded using ftp clients such as lftp, WinSCP and Filezilla. If
   you have trouble ith disconnections, we recommend FileZilla, as you can
   set it to retry up to 99 times in the options.

   Connection info:

   host:ftp.cnag.cat
   port: 22
   protocol: SFTP
   username: EASI
   password: iQiWdtdwBqmKBlWiJTC23X5

   The excel file EASI_62/EASI_62.xls indicates in which
   flowcell-lane-index combination(s) each sample was sequenced. This
   folder also contains the file EASI_62_Smple_Stats.xls, with various
   statistics describing the results obtained from your samples. Some
   columns may have values of NA (not applicable) as the analysis rquired
   for such values was either not able to be performed or not requested.

   Inside the FASTQ folder, files are named
   <flowcell>_<lane>_<index>_<read>.fastq.gz. FASTQs are in standard format
   with Sanger qualities (Phred+33).

   The md5 checksums in .md5 can be used to check if there were any errors
   during the transfer.

   Data will be available for two weeks; please let us know if you have not
   been able to download it within that period. Please keep a copy of these
   files, as we epect that you will need them in the future and the CNAG
   cannot guarantee to store them indefinitely. Don't hesitate to contact
   us if you need any help or have ay problem with the files.

   The CNAG's Data Analysis Team will contact you regarding the requested
   analysis.
